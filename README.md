# Whale Talk Project

## Description 
This project is a simple JavaScript program that translates input text into "whale talk." In whale talk, certain vowels are doubled and then converted to uppercase.

### Instructions:

- Define your input text in the input variable.
- Run the JavaScript code in a JavaScript environment (e.g., a browser console, Node.js, etc.).
- The program will output the "whale talk" version of the input text, where certain vowels are doubled and converted to uppercase.

### Example:
Input:
"turpentine and turtles"

Output:
"UUEEIEEAUUEE"

#### Notes:

- This program doubles the vowels 'e' and 'u' and converts all vowels to uppercase.
- Adjust the input variable input to translate different text into whale talk.
- Ensure you have a JavaScript environment to run the code, such as a browser console or Node.js.
